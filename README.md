## Overview

This is a lightweight Go server that connects [Hasura](https://hasura.io/) to [Segment](https://segment.com/) using Hasura's [Event Triggers](https://docs.hasura.io/1.0/graphql/manual/event-triggers/index.html) Feature. You can now easily your marketing and analytics stack using Segment whilst keeping your PostgreSQL DB as the single source of truth. The server exposes two endpoints on port `4004`.
1. `POST /webhook` - This is where Hasura needs to send the event triggers
2. `GET /health` - Healthcheck

## Configuration

Hasura Segment Source has a few configuration you need to setup.

| Environment Variable | Required | Default | Description |
| -------------------- | -------- | ------- | ----------- | 
| SEGMENT_WRITE_API_KEY | `true` | `null` | Your Segment Go Source write key.
| USER_ID_FIELD | `false` | `user_id` | The field container the user id. If this is incorrectly set or doesn't exist the user ID will be set to `anonymous`.

> Coming soon ...

### Setting Up Segment 

Follow this [Segment's Guide](https://segment.com/docs/guides/setup/how-do-i-find-my-write-key/) to help find your `SEGMENT_WRITE_API_KEY`. You will need to choose the `GoLang Server` Source.

### Setting Up Hasura

## Roadmap

- Zeit Now Config
- Actual versioning 
- Choose listening port
- Whitelist/Blacklist keys. This will allow you to control exactly which fields are sent to Segment
- Identify User Traits.
